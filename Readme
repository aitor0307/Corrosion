# CORROSION CURRENT CALCULATION
The following project aims to help corrosion researches with the determination of the corrosion current during Closed Polarisation Test.
The program will read data files of the different tests in a folder with the following structure: Lines x 4 columns, with the 3rd and 4th column being the scan Potential and Measured current, respectively. (Feel free to adapt it to your code)
It will extract the name of each of the test files with the following structure: data - ref electrode - channel - test number - test type - corrosive media (Feel free to adapt it too)
